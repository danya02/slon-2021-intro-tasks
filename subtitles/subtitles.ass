Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.77,0:00:06.08,Default,,0,0,0,,What would happen if we were to detonate a very, very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.09,0:00:11.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Would the explosion knock its orbit towards Earth, causing tidal waves and misery?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.29,0:00:16.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Could the moon be destroyed, showering the Earth in a rain of meteoric death?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.91,0:00:25.01,Default,,0,0,0,,[ Kurzgesagt intro ]
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.61,0:00:31.66,Default,,0,0,0,,During the Cold War, the moon was a major target for space exploration, and -- y'know -- military bases.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.66,0:00:38.91,Default,,0,0,0,,So the US Air Force commissioned a serious study into the effects of a nuclear detonation on the surface of the moon.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.91,0:00:44.99,Default,,0,0,0,,But just quoting stuff is boring, so let's conduct a very important scientific experiment with an
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.99,0:00:52.28,Default,,0,0,0,,imaginary 100Mt thermonuclear warhead about twice as powerful as the most powerful bomb ever detonated.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.28,0:00:57.37,Default,,0,0,0,,We'll also place a number of curious astronauts around the moon as observers.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.37,0:01:01.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Let's push the button and slow down time.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.22,0:01:06.02,Default,,0,0,0,,For the first few milliseconds, nothing much happens outside our weapon.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.02,0:01:11.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Meanwhile inside, high explosives send a shockwave to a radioactive metal core,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.55,0:01:17.49,Default,,0,0,0,,compressing it so much that it reaches criticality and starts a nuclear fission chain reaction.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.49,0:01:26.67,Default,,0,0,0,,The one-hundred-million-degree plasma created in this first stage sets off the second stage, with atomic nuclei fusing like they do in the core of a star.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.67,0:01:32.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Very briefly, our weapon contains one of the hottest places in the universe.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.54,0:01:38.82,Default,,0,0,0,,And only now, barely ten milliseconds later, does the rest of the universe find out that anything has happened,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.82,0:01:43.85,Default,,0,0,0,,as suddenly the bomb dissolves and a flaming star of nuclear death is born.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.43,0:01:45.97,Default,,0,0,0,,So far so good.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.97,0:01:51.94,Default,,0,0,0,,But everything that happens now is very different from what we're used to on Earth because of one major difference:
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.94,0:01:53.94,Default,,0,0,0,,There's no atmosphere.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.94,0:02:03.21,Default,,0,0,0,,As the fireball shines, it releases a flash of X-rays and thermal photons, a wave of silent heat which rushes outwards in all directions.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.21,0:02:08.49,Default,,0,0,0,,On Earth, this heat would char and burn everything within a 50km radius at least.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.49,0:02:13.55,Default,,0,0,0,,But on the moon, without an atmosphere and oxygen-rich air, there's no burning at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.55,0:02:16.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Also, there are no things to burn.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.25,0:02:25.54,Default,,0,0,0,,The crunchy top soil of the moon is made from silicate rock and metals, chewed to dust by eons of meteorite impacts, mixed with tiny traces of water.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.54,0:02:31.24,Default,,0,0,0,,When heated by the explosion, X-rays from the fireball vaporize a thin cloud of rock from the lunar surface,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.24,0:02:35.61,Default,,0,0,0,,while the unlucky dust that's inside the fireball melts into glass.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.61,0:02:41.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Any astronauts watching the show within about 50 kilometers can expect to be fried.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.09,0:02:46.93,Default,,0,0,0,,And now we begin to see one of the biggest differences between explosions in space and on Earth.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.93,0:02:50.67,Default,,0,0,0,,On Earth, the atmosphere fights back against the plasma bubble.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.67,0:02:55.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Its expansion is violently stopped within moments by the pressure of the atmosphere.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.70,0:02:57.49,Default,,0,0,0,,But this is not good news:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.49,0:03:03.47,Default,,0,0,0,,as the fireball rams the atmosphere, it produces the most destructive part of a nuclear explosion on earth --
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.47,0:03:04.91,Default,,0,0,0,,-- the shockwave.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.91,0:03:13.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Compressed air around the explosion rushes out faster than the speed of sound, shattering buildings and roaring so loud it ruptures organs.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.07,0:03:20.02,Default,,0,0,0,,But on the moon, there is no shockwave; no atmosphere means nothing to impede the expanding explosion in space.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.02,0:03:26.97,Default,,0,0,0,,On the moon, the fireball just grows in eerie silence as there's no atmosphere to stop it or to give it a voice.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.97,0:03:30.56,Default,,0,0,0,,This would be an amazing thing to watch from a safe distance.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.56,0:03:35.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Unfortunately, there's hardly any safe viewing distance for a nuclear explosion on the moon.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.84,0:03:40.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Without an atmosphere weakening the deadly ionizing radiation that can scramble DNA,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.40,0:03:45.63,Default,,0,0,0,,anyone close enough to get a good look will be exposed to fatal amounts of radiation.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.63,0:03:47.89,Default,,0,0,0,,But of course, that's not all!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.89,0:03:52.75,Default,,0,0,0,,While all of this happens, the explosion hammers against the moon, transferring about a tenth
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.75,0:03:57.88,Default,,0,0,0,,of the explosion energy into seismic waves, powering an intense moon-quake.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.88,0:04:05.16,Default,,0,0,0,,The moon is much smaller than the Earth, and our astronauts will feel an inescapable violent shaking no matter where they're standing.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.16,0:04:10.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Comparable to an earthquake of 7 on the Richter scale, this shaking could seriously damage
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.35,0:04:14.48,Default,,0,0,0,,or even level infrastructure we might have built anywhere on the moon.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.48,0:04:18.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Those who hid on the far side of the moon would have no idea it was an explosion;
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.26,0:04:22.64,Default,,0,0,0,,the quaking would feel like an asteroid the size of the Great Pyramid had struck.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.64,0:04:24.97,Default,,0,0,0,,And it's not over yet.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.97,0:04:30.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Where our bomb explodes, the ground splatters like water when a rock strikes a pond.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.33,0:04:36.96,Default,,0,0,0,,As the explosion pushes against the surface, it may excavate as much as a hundred million cubic meters of dust and rock,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.96,0:04:42.38,Default,,0,0,0,,forming a crater a kilometer across, while bedrock is pulverized to rubble.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.38,0:04:45.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Debris is shot into the sky in every direction.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.69,0:04:50.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Again, without an atmosphere, there's no drag to slow any of it down.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.30,0:04:56.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Much of the debris scattered never returns to the moon, flying off faster than escape velocity.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.56,0:05:00.78,Default,,0,0,0,,A flurry of micrometeorites have been cast off to explore the solar system,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.78,0:05:05.73,Default,,0,0,0,,many of which will rain down on the Earth, though few will be larger than pebbles.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.73,0:05:11.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Any satellite, astronaut, or space station in the way, though, will have a really bad time.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.57,0:05:18.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Micrometeorites are launched at many speeds and angles, allowing them to spread all over the surface of the moon.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.33,0:05:24.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Like bullets, they'll punch through our curious astronauts no matter where they stand.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.04,0:05:27.23,Default,,0,0,0,,Finally, our explosion comes to an end.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.23,0:05:32.02,Default,,0,0,0,,On Earth, the fireball rises like a hot air balloon, forming a sort of stalk.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.02,0:05:37.34,Default,,0,0,0,,As it reaches up, cooler air is drawn in around it, rounding the top into a mushroom cloud.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.34,0:05:41.79,Default,,0,0,0,,But on the moon -- well, you know by now -- no atmosphere, no mushroom.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.79,0:05:48.38,Default,,0,0,0,,The larger the plasma gets, the cooler it becomes, and the less energy it has to make interesting or terrifying things happen.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.38,0:05:53.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Within seconds of pulling the trigger, the bubble reddens and fades from view.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.32,0:05:59.22,Default,,0,0,0,,It would be visible from the Earth like a star flickering to life only to fade out right away.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.63,0:06:02.06,Default,,0,0,0,,A spark, and then nothing.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.06,0:06:08.37,Default,,0,0,0,,As the cloud of tiny debris reaches far above the surface of the moon, it's illuminated by the sun for a few minutes,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.37,0:06:13.49,Default,,0,0,0,,giving it an eerie beauty for anyone left to observe the spectacle.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.66,0:06:15.79,Default,,0,0,0,,What about the moon's orbit?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.79,0:06:18.06,Default,,0,0,0,,It's basically unchanged.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.06,0:06:22.41,Default,,0,0,0,,Trying to move the moon with a nuke is like trying to move a truck by blowing on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.41,0:06:24.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Nuclear explosions may be big,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.77,0:06:27.22,Default,,0,0,0,,but space is bigger.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.22,0:06:30.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Our mighty explosion just leaves another crater.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.28,0:06:32.33,Default,,0,0,0,,One among millions.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.33,0:06:36.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Still, anyone on the moon will continue to not enjoy themselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.65,0:06:39.92,Default,,0,0,0,,The material that ends up raining back to the moon is radioactive,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.92,0:06:46.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and without any natural processes to wash it away or bury it, the surface of the moon will remain contaminated.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.16,0:06:54.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Although fortunately, the worst of the radiation will have decayed to a level comparable to natural levels from cosmic rays in about a year.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.13,0:06:59.80,Default,,0,0,0,,In conclusion, we can say with confidence that while the moon itself does not care about being nuked
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.80,0:07:03.86,Default,,0,0,0,,and will barely notice, using the moon as a nuclear test ground
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.86,0:07:08.98,Default,,0,0,0,,kind of ruins it for everyone trying to spend some time there or to build something useful.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.98,0:07:10.98,Default,,0,0,0,,So maybe we should just...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.98,0:07:12.54,Default,,0,0,0,,not do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.90,0:07:17.49,Default,,0,0,0,,This was our last video of the year 12020, and...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.49,0:07:21.21,Default,,0,0,0,,oh dear, what an interesting and weird year it's been, in all the worst ways.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.21,0:07:22.76,Default,,0,0,0,,But it's finally over.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.76,0:07:24.76,Default,,0,0,0,,We want to end it by saying: thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.76,0:07:29.55,Default,,0,0,0,,We get to do this channel and work on many exciting things because of you birbs.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.55,0:07:36.65,Default,,0,0,0,,This year our German channel reached a million subscribers, we launched our Spanish one, and released our first app.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.65,0:07:41.38,Default,,0,0,0,,If everything goes well, we can finally start our largest new project to date next year,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.38,0:07:43.69,Default,,0,0,0,,but we know better than to promise too much.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.69,0:07:46.42,Default,,0,0,0,,All of this works because you support us directly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.42,0:07:50.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Thank you so much; we genuinely appreciate it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.16,0:07:53.18,Default,,0,0,0,,If you want to help us out too and get something cool in return --
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.18,0:07:54.76,Default,,0,0,0,,-- to the tune of nuking the moon --
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.76,0:08:00.49,Default,,0,0,0,,-- we've made a new minimalistic infographic poster about the moon and how incredibly far away it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.49,0:08:03.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Also, there's a baby duck, our cutest plushie yet;
